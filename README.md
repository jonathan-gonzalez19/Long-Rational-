## LongRacional: A Java Program for Long Rational Numbers

The `LongRacional` class is a Java Program designed to handle long rational numbers with precision. This project showcases skills in string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and object-oriented programming.

### Key Features

- **Initialization**: Create long rational numbers from whole and decimal parts, with support for positive and negative values.
- **String Representation**: Convert rational numbers to a string format, maintaining precision and sign.
- **Negation**: Generate the negative of a given rational number.
- **Addition and Subtraction**: Perform arithmetic operations on rational numbers, handling carry and borrow operations across decimal and whole parts.
- **Developed** my own ParseInT method to convert String to integers when needed.  
- **Zero Elimination**: Remove leading and trailing zeros from the whole and decimal parts for a cleaner representation.

### Learning Outcomes

- Developed expertise in handling numerical operations with string-based representations.
- Enhanced understanding of precision arithmetic and edge case management in Java.
- Improved skills in designing and implementing object-oriented solutions for complex data types.

### Usage

To use the `LongRacional` class, instantiate it with the desired values and utilize the provided methods to perform operations on the rational numbers.
